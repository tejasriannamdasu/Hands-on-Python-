# Hands-on-Python-
This Python program takes multiple request values and categorizes them into No, Low, Moderate, High, and Invalid demands.
Negative values are treated as invalid and ignored.
It applies personalization using PLI = len(name) % 3 to remove one demand category.
The program displays results before and after personalization.
Built using basic Python concepts like lists, loops, and conditionals.
